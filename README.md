# Postgres AM Demo
This repo demo's the use of the PostgreSQL Table Access Method (TAM) API for custom storage
implementations.  See [my article](https://www.example.com) for details.

# License
This repo inherits the Postgres license due to its use of Michael Paqiuer's blackhole template.
Thanks for providing that!
